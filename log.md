# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Started #100DaysOfCode Challenge. My first project is cloning an app called DayBreak, which is developed by Hello Sunday Morning's team. It is an app to help people to overcome alcohol problems. Today, I worked on icon mood component, which is based on a stateless React Native component.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with some tricks on React Native for granting shareability of the code, but the hardest part was make the result UI works on both Android and iOS.

### Day 2: January 04, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Started to include Mood-Card component. It will have 3 sections, or child components - Header, Short Description, and Footer. The Header component is almost completed, but I still have to think about how to make it more reusable.

**Thoughts:** Make this app has been challenging and exciting. I know that are so many improvements to do, but I think the dots are beginning to connect.

**Today's Progress**: Started #100DaysOfCode Challenge. My first project is cloning an app called DayBreak, which is developed by Hello Sunday Morning's team. It is an app to help people to overcome alcohol problems. Today, I worked on icon mood component, which is based on a stateless React Native component.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with some tricks o React Native for granting shareability of the code, but the hardest part was make the result UI works on both Android and iOS.
